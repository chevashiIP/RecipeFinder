# RecipeFinder
A simple recipe finder. 

For main page I used Okhttp to make requests to the Spoonacular API and parsed the json string to store it in RecyclerView.
For more detailed recipe page I used ViewPager with fragments.
Also added an AWS cognito sign up page so user will have to create account before query a search.

In order to get it working you need to provide your own API key for Spoonacular. You can get it on RapidAPI website.
